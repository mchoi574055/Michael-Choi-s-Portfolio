   <h3 class = "Label-1">Worked from December 2022 â€“ June 2023. As a Software Engineer at Build-It-Yourself, my primary responsibility was to enhance the digital experience for our young users. I was involved in the front-end development of the platform's React application, which serves as a social networking site for children to showcase their work.

    <br></br> I played a pivotal role in implementing significant features, such as a comment system, which encouraged engagement and interaction among the users. Furthermore, I expertly handled various bugs in the front-end, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.
    
    <br></br> Additionally, I utilized AWS services for the backend. I set up and managed the user authentication and authorization using AWS Cognito, thus ensuring the security of user data. I also utilized AWS Lambda for function execution and AWS DynamoDB for database management.</h3>

    <h3 class = "Label-1">Worked from June 2022 - September 2022. As a Software Engineer Intern at Jendia Studios, my role was multi-faceted and involved working on various aspects of game development and infrastructure. I was instrumental in creating major gameplay features for the flagship third-person adventure game, Stellar Skies.
      <br></br>
      I was in charge of developing a scalable dialogue system using NotYetGame's Dialogue Plugin System and Unreal blueprints. This system facilitated interactive dialogues and helped make the game characters more engaging and realistic. 
      Another significant contribution was the design and implementation of an efficient interaction system. This system allowed a player to trigger specific game events through interactions, thus making the game more immersive.
      <br></br>
      I also practiced Scrum methodologies, where I played a key role in improving the processes during our bi-weekly sprints.
